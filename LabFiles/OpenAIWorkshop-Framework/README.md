## What You Can Do With This Repo  
  
- **Design and prototype AI agent solutions** for real-world business scenarios
- **Explore single-agent and multi-agent architectures** with different orchestration patterns
- **Build with Microsoft Agent Framework** - advanced multi-agent orchestration, handoffs, and checkpointing
- **Build end-to-end agentic AI systems** - Complete architecture from backend database, MCP tools server, agent orchestration, application backend, to React/Streamlit frontend
- **Deploy to Azure with enterprise security** - VNet, private endpoints, managed identity, and CI/CD automation

## Key Features  

- **[Microsoft Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) Integration** - Single-agent, multi-agent Magentic orchestration, and handoff-based domain routing with MCP tools. [Pattern guide →](agentic_ai/agents/agent_framework/README.md)
- **[Workflow Orchestration](agentic_ai/workflow/)** - Hybrid Workflow + Durable Task architecture with fan-out/fan-in topology, human-in-the-loop, and real-time observability. [Fraud Detection Demo →](agentic_ai/workflow/fraud_detection_durable/)
- **[Observability with Application Insights](agentic_ai/observability/)** - Full tracing of agent executions, tool calls, and LLM invocations with pre-built Grafana dashboards. [Setup Guide →](agentic_ai/observability/README.md)
- **Advanced UI Options** - React frontend with interactive workflow visualization and step-by-step tool call details
- **[MCP Server Integration](mcp/)** - Model Context Protocol for enhanced agent tool capabilities with advanced features: authentication, RBAC, and APIM integration
- **[Agent Evaluations](agentic_ai/evaluations/)** - Evaluate agent performance with custom metrics and test datasets
- **Agent State & History Persistence** - In-memory or CosmosDB backend for conversation history and agent state
- **[Enterprise-Ready Reference Architecture](infra/README.md)** - Production-grade deployment with VNet integration, private endpoints, managed identity, and Terraform/Bicep IaC
- **[CI/CD Pipeline](.github/workflows/readme.md)** - Automated dev-to-production promotion with per-developer environments, OIDC auth, agent evaluation gates, and doc-change filtering

## Getting Started  
  
1. Review the [Setup Instructions](./SETUP.md) for environment prerequisites and step-by-step installation.  
2. Explore the [Business Scenario and Agent Design](./SCENARIO.md) to understand the workshop challenge.  
3. Check out the **[Agent Framework Implementation Patterns](agentic_ai/agents/agent_framework/README.md)** to choose the right multi-agent approach (single-agent, Magentic orchestration, or handoff pattern).
4. Try the **[Durable Fraud Detection Workflow](agentic_ai/workflow/fraud_detection_durable/)** to see hybrid Workflow + Durable Task orchestration with human-in-the-loop.
5. Dive into [System Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md) before building and customizing your agent solutions.  
6. Utilize the [Support Guide](./SUPPORT.md) for troubleshooting and assistance.
